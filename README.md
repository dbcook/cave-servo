# cave-servo

This repo contains various design and implementation artifacts for my restoration and servo drive conversion of a 1975 Cave Optical "Astrola 8 inch Model B Deluxe" telescope.  This is considered
a classic golden age Newtonian reflector, and the optical figure of the Cave primary mirrors was
often exceptional.
