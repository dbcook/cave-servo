# Holes for Servo Drive Panel

This gives the drill sizes for mounting holes in the panel that are too small to be profiled with a
small end mill.  They were drilled using the mill-drill capability of the PM-30MV.
After referencing the mill axes, the mill head was postiioned to the location of each hole,
which was then drilled by hand using the quill.

Mounting for Ultimate GPS module 0.090 (2 places) #42 is 0.0935
Passthru for u.FL antenna connector 0.135 (1 place) #29 is 0.136
Fan control pot anti-rotate hole 0.113 (1 place) #33 is 0.113
Handle mounting holes 0.201 (2 places each orientation) #7 is 0.201
Meter switch hole 0.350 (1 place)  S drill is 0.348 - can also be done with the 1/8" end mill


Protrusion of 118˚ drill point is r*sin(31˚)
*   0.348 hole:  0.090  - right on the thickness of the spoil plate
*   0.201 hole:  0.052  - only a bit more than half way thru the 0.092 plexi spoil plate
*   Therefore we can drill all holes directly *except* the meter switch and pot - contour those with 1/8" end mill
